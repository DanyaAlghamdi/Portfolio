							<h1>Create a website for local business</h1>
							<p>This is a project for UX immersive course at Misk Academy.
							 The main objective of this project  is to create a website for a local business. </p>

							</br></br></br>

				


							 <h2>Research</h2>
							 <p>Our task was to conduct user research and business research to develop a solution
							 for customers who buy pins to enhance their shopping experience. </br> <strong>Research goal</strong>
							 The main objective of this project is to create a platform for Al-Maigliah customers.</p>
							 
							
							 <h2>User Research</h2>
							 <p>We start with desk research by looking at customers reviews on social media to learn about
							 their  shopping experiences and behavior at the store. </p>


							 <h3>User Interviews</h3>
							 <p>We created a screener survey in order to determine the peoples who are interested in pins.
								  From 23 we only interviewed 11. We focused on users who bay online and we asked them about their experience,
								  what they like, and the pain point. In order to come up with a solution to improve the shopping experience. </p>
							</br>
							 <h2>What people’s said</h2>
							 <p>Here we used affinity mapping that help us to sort and cluster the answers into 
								 organizeed group. that helped us find patterns of thinking.  Also, show us where
								 the majority of people's minds are focused. </p>
							 <img style="margin-left: 180px" src="images/affinity map p2.png" alt="" />

							</br></br>
							 <h3>What we found (Insights)</h3>
							 <p>from the answers we reached to : </br> 1- Users prefer to use website than
								other methods.</br> 2- Users would love to read more 
								about the product in the Product description. </br> 3- Users don’t like to fill out 
								 information and go through many steps.</br>4- Users like simple, clear and
								 few products in the page. </br>5- Users think before buying a product
								 if they need it or not, and they compare between different stores. </br>6- Users are aware and disappointed
								 when features such as search and related items are not working as intended.
								 </p>
							</br> </br>

							    <h2>User Persona</h2>
								<p>From the earlier research and the data, we created a persona that representative of the target users.</p>
								<img style="margin-left: 180px" src="images/persona2p2.png" alt="" />


						</br> </br></br>

						        <h2>Business Research</h2>
								<p>After understanding the business, we wanted to go into Sara Pins Store's competitors to know how they help their customers during online shopping.
									 Based on our research, we found some direct (local stores) and indirect (global stores) competitors sell the same products.
									We conducted business research in order to understand the industries and come up with key features for the platform.</p>

									<p>Start by<strong> Competitive analysis</strong> is a technique for gathering and comparing information about companies.
									 We used this strategy to better understand our competitors so that we could develop a solution that was on par with theirs.</p>
									 <img style="margin-left: 180px" src="images/C&C p2.png" alt="" />

									</br></br>

									 <p>Then we did <strong>Heuristic evaluation</strong> which is a method to measure the usability of user interfaces and report issues.</p>
									 <img style="margin-left: 170px"  src="images/HE.png" alt="" />
									</br>
									 <h3>Key Featuers</h3>
									 <p>From business analysis : </br> 1- Provide a detailed information about every product to 
										increase the customer’s confidence by giving him all the 
										information they needs.  </br> 2- website should be easy to use and navigate for a better
										user experience. </br>3- Reviews, ratings and filters are valued features.</p>


									</br></br></br></br></br>

								<h2>Problem</h2>

							<dl style="text-indent: 150px">
								<dd >Navgation bar</dd>
								<dd>Filtration feature</dd>

							 ( low fedilty ) by add elements together using figma.</p>
							 <span class="image main"><img src="images/low frame.png" alt="" /></span>

							</br></br>

							<h2>Testing</h2></br>
							<img src="images/testing.png" alt="" /> </br>
							<p>We conducted usability tests on participants to assess 
								the effectiveness of the website process.</br>
								Areas for improvement were participants faced some issues on a different screen, 
								some items appeared out of range, large components in the checkout page made it difficult for users to 
								easily navigate, some participants tried to use a sort tool but couldn’t find it.</p>
